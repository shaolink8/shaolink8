Hello!

My name is Shaolin Kataria. 

I'm interested in applications of <b>IoT, Robotics and Blockchain.</b> 
There are various projects you'll find pertaining to these domains as you browse through my repositories. 

You'll find some more projects under various other domains where I haven't actually expertised the concept but I have a decent grip on the basics.
Such domains are <b>Augmented Reality, Sound Production, designing a very basic iOS Application, Databases, Chatbot, Game Dev and Web Dev.</b>

I'm currently learning <b>Flutter</b> and trying my hand at <b>App Development</b>. I'm also working on <b>patents</b> and <b>research papers</b> right now.

You can always reach out to me
