Hello world!

My name is Shaolin Kataria. 

I'm interested in applications of IoT, Robotics and Blockchain. 
There are various projects you'll find pertaining to these domains as you browse through my repositories. 

You'll find some more projects under various other domains where I haven't actually expertised the concept but I have a decent grip on the basics.
Such domains are Augmented Reality, Sound Production, designing a very basic iOS Application, databases, chat bot, game dev and web dev.

I'm currently learning Flutter and trying my hand at App Development. I'm also working on patents and research papers right now.

You can always reach out to me either via mail : shaolink123@gmail.com or my LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaolink/

Cheers! :)
